What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan\'s list; the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, on Wednesday, was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming. Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture\nEND CHUNK CONTENT\n\nReturn a strictly valid JSON object with:\n- "label": one of [requirement, decision, stakeholder_feedback, timeline_reference, noise]\n- "confidence": float 0.0 to 1.0 (High confidence means the content explicitly matches the definition)\n- "reasoning": brief explanation of why it fits the label (or why it is noise)\n\nJSON Response:\n'}], 'model': 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.0}}

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan\'s list; the need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, on Wednesday, was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic consolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time consuming. Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the inability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the consolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can arrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to happen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the consolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude building a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the future, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm requirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project plan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture\nEND CHUNK CONTENT\n\nReturn a strictly valid JSON object with:\n- "label": one of [requirement, decision, stakeholder_feedback, timeline_reference, noise]\n- "confidence": float 0.0 to 1.0 (High confidence means the content explicitly matches the definition)\n- "reasoning": brief explanation of why it fits the label (or why it is noise)\n\nJSON Response:\n'}], 'model': 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.0}}

It appears that a single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas. At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation. Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27. These are the complete list of trades from Enron Online (EOL), Enron\'s direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon). Please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary. We have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread relationships. The two key points from this data are as follows: 1. The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 2.

We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan. This would produce an average sq footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000. (I thought his sales price was $187,000.) At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell for $203,108. What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the rent-ability. You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own evaluation. As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the 3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market. In fact, if we were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom units along with the 3-bedroom plan. Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.

REASONING: The email contains a discussion about a potential deal and the requirements for a power generation project, which can be considered as stakeholder feedback about the project or product. However, it's not directly related to the digital transformation project, and the tone is more about a business opportunity than feedback on the project.

It appears that a single buyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas. At the time of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index calculation. Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated financial swaps for San Juan. We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from September 25 to September 27. These are the complete list of trades from Enron Online (EOL), Enron\'s direct phone conversations, and three brokerage firms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon). Please see the attached spreadsheet for a trade by trade list and a summary. We have also included a summary of gas daily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread relationships. The two key points from this data are as follows: 1. The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater than the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. 2. The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & Northwest) is consistent between the end of September and Octob\nEND CHUNK CONTENT\n\nReturn a strictly valid JSON object with:\n- "label": one of [requirement, decision, stakeholder_feedback, timeline_reference, noise]\n- "confidence": float 0.0 to 1.0 (High confidence means the content explicitly matches the definition)\n- "reasoning": brief explanation of why it fits the label (or why it is noise)\n\nJSON Response:\n'}], 'model': 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.0}}

We do not know the exact size of each of his units, but we believe one of the duplexes is a 1164/1302 sq ft. plan. This would produce an average sq footage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000. (I thought his sales price was $187,000.) At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell for $203,108. What is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the rent-ability. You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own evaluation. As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the 3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market. In fact, if we were able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom units along with the 3-bedroom plan. Phillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.

Without the email address, we cannot email them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can we send them an automatic reminder via email. It would also be good to have each person\'s phone number, in the event we need to reach them. So, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need to instead, provide the needed information via email. Thank you for your assistance Phillip. Christi L.

REASONING: The email is asking for IT support regarding password and domain access for the expost hourly summary, which is not related to the project requirements or direction, but rather a support request.

Now that we have had several traders managing transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss any issues you have with the way the model works. I have asked Zimin Lu (Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they will be available to answer any technical questions.

LABEL: noise
CONFIDENCE: 0.95
REASONING: The email discusses specific details about 'Project Elvis and Cactus Open Gas Position', including numerical data and a proposal for a conference call. However, it does not directly relate to the requirements, decisions, or feedback about the new system being built. It appears to be a business discussion about a specific project or deal, not directly related to a digital transformation project or the system/product being developed.

We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub on April 27th to discuss asset management. In preparation for that meeting we would like to gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW. Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW. What are typical quantities and term on sales? Are there any services we provide? How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them? Who are your main contacts at SW Gas? We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our control of their assets. For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the commissions. This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) should look like. Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month index may not be attractive unless we accept their reg\nEND CHUNK CONTENT\n\nReturn a strictly valid JSON object with:\n- "label": one of [requirement, decision, stakeholder_feedback, timeline_reference, noise]\n- "confidence": float 0.0 to 1.0 (High confidence means the content explicitly matches the definition)\n- "reasoning": brief explanation of why it fits the label (or why it is noise)\n\nJSON Response:\n'}], 'model': 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.0}}

We are meeting with Larry Black, Bob Armstrong & Ed Zub on April 27th to discuss asset management. In preparation for that meeting we would like to gain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW. Could you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW. What are typical quantities and term on sales? Are there any services we provide? How much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them? Who are your main contacts at SW Gas? We will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our control of their assets. For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably have to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the commissions. This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their commissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) should look like. Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month index may not be attractive unless we accept their reg\nEND CHUNK CONTENT\n\nReturn a strictly valid JSON object with:\n- "label": one of [requirement, decision, stakeholder_feedback, timeline_reference, noise]\n- "confidence": float 0.0 to 1.0 (High confidence means the content explicitly matches the definition)\n- "reasoning": brief explanation of why it fits the label (or why it is noise)\n\nJSON Response:\n'}], 'model': 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.0}}

LABEL: noise
CONFIDENCE: 0.95
REASONING: The email content discusses a meeting with SW Gas to discuss asset management and details about their business relationship. It does not contain any statements of need for a new system, product, or process, nor does it include a clear decision about the project direction, stakeholder feedback about the project, or explicit project delivery dates. The content is primarily about business operations and a specific meeting, thus it is considered noise.

**Metric**: Project plan document completion by the agreed-upon deadline.\n   - **Validation**: Stakeholder approval of the project plan.\n\n2. **Single Set of Requirements**: Establishing a single set of requirements for the consolidated position screen.\n   - **Metric**: Number of requirements documents consolidated into one.\n   - **Validation**: Stakeholder agreement on the consolidated requirements.\n\n3. **Design of a Desired Layout for the Consolidated Position Screen**: Achieving a consensus on the layout.\n   - **Metric**: Completion of a defined layout design within the allocated time frame (e.g., by Monday from 3 - 5 PM).\n   - **Validation**: Stakeholder consensus on the layout design.\n\n#### Secondary Objectives\n1. **Flexible Position Presentation Capability**: Planning for a future capability to allow traders to customize the position screen.\n   - **Metric**: Inclusion of a flexible position presentation capability in the project plan or roadmap.\n   - **Validation**: Stakeholder acknowledgment of the planned capability.\n\n2. **Access and Administrative Rights Management**: Ensuring appropriate access and administrative rights for new products (e.g., El Paso Blanco Avg physical NG product).\n   - **Metric**: Timely provision of view access to internal gas traders and administrative access to designated personnel.\n   - **Validation**: Confirmation from relevant stakeholders (e.g., Kenneth Shulklapper) of access provision.\n\n### Suggested Metrics Needing Stakeholder Validation\n- **User Adoption Rate**: Measure of how frequently the consolidated position screen is used by traders.\n- **Error Reduction**: Comparison of errors before and after the implementation of the consolidated positions and transport trade capture system.\n- **Time-to-Market for New Products**: Measurement of the time taken to grant access and manage new products.\n\nThese suggested metrics need validation from stakeholders to ensure they align with the project\'s overall goals and objectives.\n\n--- ASSUMPTIONS ---\n### AI-inferred assumptions requiring stakeholder validation\n\nThe following assumptions are inferred from the provided communications and may require validation from stakeholders:\n\n* The project team assumes that the stakeholders have a clear understanding of the requirements for the consolidated physical/financial positions and transport trade capture.\n* It is assumed that the traders will be able to agree on a desired layout for the consolidated position screen during the meeting scheduled for Monday from 3 - 5.\n* The team assumes that the current technical infrastructure (e.g., hardware, software, and network) will be sufficient to support the development and implementation of the consolidated position screen.\n* The project assumes that the stakeholders have the necessary expertise and resources to develop a project plan for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport trade capture.\n* It is assumed that the transportation model is currently being used by traders and that the issues with the model will be addressed during the meeting scheduled for August 11.\n* The team assumes that the stakeholders have access to the necessary data and systems (e.g., EOL, West Calendar) to support the development and implementation of the consolidated position screen.\n* It is assumed that the project timeline and milestones will be feasible and achievable based on the current understanding of the project requirements.\n* The project assumes that the stakeholders will be available and responsive to the project team\'s requests for information and feedback.\n* It is assumed that the security and access controls for the system (e.g., view access, administrative access) will be sufficient to protect sensitive information.\n\nThese assumptions may impact the project\'s success and should be validated with stakeholders to ensure that they are accurate and reasonable.\n\nMetaData: This session processed 12 total signals from 9 documents.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Write a 3-5 paragraph executive summary covering:\n   - What the project aims to achieve (based on requirements).\n   - Who the key stakeholders are.\n   - Major constraints or risks (based on decisions/feedback).\n2. Honest Completeness Statement: You MUST end the summary with an honest assessment of data completeness.\n   - Explicitly state which sections had insufficient data if any.\n   - You MUST include a sentence matching this format exactly: "This BRD was generated from <total_signals> signals extracted from <unique_sources> source documents."\nOutput ONLY the final markdown content for this section.\n'}], 'model': 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct', 'response_format': None, 'temperature': 0.0}}

[0891cdfa-97e1-42cf-9ee9-8a91d1826d35]\n\n## Contradictions / Gaps\n* Requirements 2 and 4 appear to be contradictory, as requirement 2 suggests a highly customizable screen, while requirement 4 emphasizes the need for firm requirements, which may limit customization. \n* The exact layout and design of the consolidated position screen are not specified, leaving it unclear what the "desired layout" (requirement 1) entails. \n* The scope of "transport trade capture" is not clearly defined, leaving it unclear what specific functionality is required.\n\n--- TIMELINE ---\n## Project Timeline\n* July 10, 2000: Systems Meeting scheduled for July 11, 2000 [b6fdf6bb-07a2-43de-add1-971df7629b04]\n* July 11, 2000: Systems Meeting held at 2:00 pm in EB3321 [b6fdf6bb-07a2-43de-add1-971df7629b04]\n* July 14, 2000: Initial comments on Order 637 Compliance Filings sent via email [37541964-636c-4ea0-8c0b-b48657843b13]\n* July 17, 2000: Email with comments on Order 637 Compliance Filings forwarded by Phillip K Allen [37541964-636c-4ea0-8c0b-b48657843b13]\n* July 17, 2000 (or shortly after): Order 637 Compliance Filings to be made for certain pipelines (filing date not explicitly stated but mentioned to be on Monday) [37541964-636c-4ea0-8c0b-b48657843b13]\n* September 26, 2000: Email sent scheduling a meeting on Gas Physical/Financial Position for September 28, 2000 [f9a2cbbb-88ca-4af4-8614-c0ea71ca638a]\n* September 28, 2000: Meeting on Gas Physical/Financial Position scheduled from 3:00 - 4:00 in Room EB2537 [f9a2cbbb-88ca-4af4-8614-c0ea71ca638a]\n\n--- SUCCESS_METRICS ---\n### Success Metrics for Consolidated Physical/Financial Positions and Transport Trade Capture Project\n\nThe following success metrics are derived based on the provided requirements and decisions:\n\n#### Primary Objectives\n1. **Completion of a Project Plan**: The primary success metric is the completion of a project plan for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport trade capture.\n   - **Metric**: Project plan document completion by the agreed-upon deadline.\n   - **Validation**: Stakeholder approval of the project plan.\n\n2. **Single Set of Requirements**: Establishing a single set of requirements for the consolidated position screen.\n   - **Metric**: Number of requirements documents consolidated into one.\n   - **Validation**: Stakeholder agreement on the consolidated requirements.\n\n3. **Design of a Desired Layout for the Consolidated Position Screen**: Achieving a consensus on the layout.\n   - **Metric**: Completion of a defined layout design within the allocated time frame (e.g., by Monday from 3 - 5 PM).\n   - **Validation**: Stakeholder consensus on the layout design.\n\n#### Secondary Objectives\n1. **Flexible Position Presentation Capability**: Planning for a future capability to allow traders to customize the position screen.\n   - **Metric**: Inclusion of a flexible position presentation capability in the project plan or roadmap.\n   - **Validation**: Stakeholder acknowledgment of the planned capability.\n\n2. **Access and Administrative Rights Management**: Ensuring appropriate access and administrative rights for new products (e.g., El Paso Blanco Avg physical NG product).\n   - **Metric**: Timely provision of view access to internal gas traders and administrative access to designated personnel.\n   - **Validation**: Confirmation from relevant stakeholders (e.g., Kenneth Shulklapper) of access provision.\n\n### Suggested Metrics Needing Stakeholder Validation\n- **User Adoption Rate**: Measure of how frequently the consolidated position screen is used by traders.\n- **Error Reduction**: Comparison of errors before and after the implementation of the consolidated positions and transport trade capture system.\n- **Time-to-Market for New Products**: Measurement of the time taken to grant access and manage new products.\n\nThese suggested metrics need validation from stakeholders to ensure they align with the project\'s overall goals and objectives.\n\n--- ASSUMPTIONS ---\n### AI-inferred assumptions requiring stakeholder validation\n\nThe following assumptions are inferred from the provided communications and may require validation from stakeholders:\n\n* The project team assumes that the stakeholders have a clear understanding of the requirements for the consolidated physical/financial positions and transport trade capture.\n* It is assumed that the traders will be able to agree on a desired layout for the consolidated position screen during the meeting scheduled for Monday from 3 - 5.\n* The team assumes that the current technical infrastructure (e.g., hardware, software, and network) will be sufficient to support the development and implementation of the consolidated position screen.\n* The project assumes that the stakeholders have the necessary expertise and resources to develop a project plan for consolidated physical/financial positions and transport trade capture.\n* It is assumed that the transportation model is currently being used by traders and that the issues with the model will be addressed during the meeting scheduled for August 11.\n* The team assumes that the stakeholders have access to the necessary data and systems (e.g., EOL, West Calendar) to support the development and implementation of the consolidated position screen.\n* It is assumed that the project timeline and milestones will be feasible and achievable based on the current understanding of the project requirements.\n* The project assumes that the stakeholders will be available and responsive to the project team\'s requests for information and feedback.\n* It is assumed that the security and access controls for the system (e.g., view access, administrative access) will be sufficient to protect sensitive information.\n\nThese assumptions may impact the project\'s success and should be validated with stakeholders to ensure that they are accurate and reasonable.\n\nMetaData: This session processed 12 total signals from 9 documents.\n\nInstructions:\n1. Write a 3-5 paragraph executive summary covering:\n   - What the project aims to achieve (based on requirements).\n   - Who the key stakeholders are.\n   - Major constraints or risks (based on decisions/feedback).\n2. Honest Completeness Statement: You MUST end the summary with an honest assessment of data completeness.\n   - Explicitly state which sections had insufficient data if any.\n   - You MUST include a sentence matching this format exactly: "This BRD was generated from <total_signals> signals extracted from <unique_sources> source documents."\nOutput ONLY the final markdown content for this section.\n'}], 'model': 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct', 'response_format': None, 'temperature': 0.0}}

What we need to focus on is the first bullet in Allan\'s list; \nthe need for a single set of requirements. Although the meeting with Keith, \non Wednesday,  was informative the solution of creating a infinitely dynamic \nconsolidated position screen, will be extremely difficult and time \nconsuming.  Throughout the meeting on Wednesday, Keith alluded to the \ninability to get consensus amongst the traders on the presentation of the \nconsolidated position, so the solution was to make it so that a trader can \narrange the position screen to their liking (much like Excel). What needs to \nhappen on Monday from 3 - 5 is a effort to design a desired layout for the \nconsolidated position screen, this is critical. This does not exclude \nbuilding a capability to create a more flexible position presentation for the \nfuture, but in order to create a plan that can be measured we need firm \nrequirements. Also, to reiterate that the goals of this project is a project \nplan on consolidate physical/financial positions and transport trade capture. \nThe other issues that have been raised will be capture as projects on to \nthemselves, and will need to be prioritised as efforts outside of this \nproject.\n\nI have been involved in most of the meetings and the discussions have been \ngood. I believe there has been good communication between the teams, but now \nwe need to have focus on the objectives we set out to solve.\n\nRichard\nEND CHUNK CONTENT\n\nReturn a strictly valid JSON object with:\n- "label": one of [requirement, decision, stakeholder_feedback, timeline_reference, noise]\n- "confidence": float 0.0 to 1.0 (High confidence means the content explicitly matches the definition)\n- "reasoning": brief explanation of why it fits the label (or why it is noise)\n\nJSON Response:\n'}], 'model': 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.0}}

It appears that a single \nbuyer entered the marketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above \nmarket prices ($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas.  At the time of these trades, \noffers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 cents) lower prices were \nbypassed in order to establish higher trades to report into the index \ncalculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of line with the associated \nfinancial swaps for San Juan.\n\n We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from \nSeptember 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from \nEnron Online (EOL), Enron\'s direct phone conversations, and three brokerage \nfirms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).

The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\nliability of construction.\n\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor\'s share of profits\nis reduced.\n\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\nnon-recourse.\n\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\n\nEARLY LAND COSTS\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\n\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\nthe "fiscals".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\nimprovements have bee\nEND CHUNK CONTENT\n\nReturn a strictly valid JSON object with:\n- "label": one of [requirement, decision, stakeholder_feedback, timeline_reference, noise]\n- "confidence": float 0.0 to 1.0 (High confidence means the content explicitly matches the definition)\n- "reasoning": brief explanation of why it fits the label (or why it is noise)\n\nJSON Response:\n'}], 'model': 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.0}}

A single buyer entered the \nmarketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices \n($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index.  At the \ntime of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 \ncents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to \nreport into the index calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of \nline with the associated financial swaps for San Juan.\n\n We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from \nSeptember 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from \nEnron Online (EOL), Enron\'s direct phone conversations, and three brokerage \nfirms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a \ntrade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas \ndaily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread \nrelationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:\n\n 1.

As you can tell from the proforma this project\nshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.\nThis is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as\nAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for\nthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we\nhave uncovered to date in the Austin market.\nThe project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As\nit is in the "Smart Growth Corridor" area designated by the City of Austin\nfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete\nin less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe\nwater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot\nimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North\nAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street\nwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street\nwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond\nrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.\n The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not\nexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite\nsuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the\nadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.\nAs with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods\nis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may\nonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far\npreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer\npreferences.\nThe seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and\nan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site\nplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into\nan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.\nThis analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the\nprofits of the project.

This would produce an average sq\nfootage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his\nsales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell\nfor $203,108.\nWhat is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the\nrent-ability.

A single buyer entered the \nmarketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices \n($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index.  At the \ntime of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 \ncents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to \nreport into the index calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of \nline with the associated financial swaps for San Juan.\n\n We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from \nSeptember 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from \nEnron Online (EOL), Enron\'s direct phone conversations, and three brokerage \nfirms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a \ntrade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas \ndaily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread \nrelationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:\n\n 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater \nthan the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. \n\n 2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & \nNorthwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and \n       October gas daily.  It doesn\'t make sense to have monthly indeces that \nare dramatically different.\n\n I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the \ntrades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to \ndetermine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70\'s and these trades are \noutliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in \nestablishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron\'s belief that the trades at \n$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the \ncalculation of index.\n\n It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to \nconduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me \nanytime I can assist you towards this goal.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPhillip Allen\nEND CHUNK CONTENT\n\nReturn a strictly valid JSON object with:\n- "label": one of [requirement, decision, stakeholder_feedback, timeline_reference, noise]\n- "confidence": float 0.0 to 1.0 (High confidence means the content explicitly matches the definition)\n- "reasoning": brief explanation of why it fits the label (or why it is noise)\n\nJSON Response:\n'}], 'model': 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.0}}

Crocker" \n<clclegal2@aol.com> \nSubject: Investment Structure\n\nSTRUCTURE:\nTypically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\ngeneral partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\nliability of construction.\n\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor\'s share of profits\nis reduced.\n\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\nnon-recourse.\n\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\n\nEARLY LAND COSTS\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\n\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\nthe "fiscals".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\nimprovements have bee\nEND CHUNK CONTENT\n\nReturn a strictly valid JSON object with:\n- "label": one of [requirement, decision, stakeholder_feedback, timeline_reference, noise]\n- "confidence": float 0.0 to 1.0 (High confidence means the content explicitly matches the definition)\n- "reasoning": brief explanation of why it fits the label (or why it is noise)\n\nJSON Response:\n'}], 'model': 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.0}}

The land is selling for $2.50 per square\nfoot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West\nSan Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.\n\nSeveral new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes\nand for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25\nper square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and\n$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This\nproperty will have the best location for student housing of all new\nprojects, just as the duplexes do now.\n\nIf this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there\nis a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not\nyet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will\nknow more on this question later today.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeorge W.

This would produce an average sq\nfootage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his\nsales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell\nfor $203,108.\nWhat is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the\nrent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own\nevaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the\n3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if we\nwere able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom\nunits along with the 3-bedroom plan.\nPhillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.\nSincerely,\nGeorge W.

A single buyer entered the \nmarketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices \n($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index.  At the \ntime of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 \ncents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to \nreport into the index calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of \nline with the associated financial swaps for San Juan.\n\n We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from \nSeptember 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from \nEnron Online (EOL), Enron\'s direct phone conversations, and three brokerage \nfirms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a \ntrade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas \ndaily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread \nrelationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:\n\n 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater \nthan the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. \n\n 2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & \nNorthwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and \n       October gas daily.  It doesn\'t make sense to have monthly indeces that \nare dramatically different.\n\n I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the \ntrades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to \ndetermine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70\'s and these trades are \noutliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in \nestablishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron\'s belief that the trades at \n$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the \ncalculation of index.\n\n It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to \nconduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me \nanytime I can assist you towards this goal.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPhillip Allen\nEND CHUNK CONTENT\n\nReturn a strictly valid JSON object with:\n- "label": one of [requirement, decision, stakeholder_feedback, timeline_reference, noise]\n- "confidence": float 0.0 to 1.0 (High confidence means the content explicitly matches the definition)\n- "reasoning": brief explanation of why it fits the label (or why it is noise)\n\nJSON Response:\n'}], 'model': 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.0}}

The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\nliability of construction.\n\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor\'s share of profits\nis reduced.\n\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\nnon-recourse.\n\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\n\nEARLY LAND COSTS\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\n\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\nthe "fiscals".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\nimprovements have bee\nEND CHUNK CONTENT\n\nReturn a strictly valid JSON object with:\n- "label": one of [requirement, decision, stakeholder_feedback, timeline_reference, noise]\n- "confidence": float 0.0 to 1.0 (High confidence means the content explicitly matches the definition)\n- "reasoning": brief explanation of why it fits the label (or why it is noise)\n\nJSON Response:\n'}], 'model': 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.0}}

As you can tell from the proforma this project\nshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.\nThis is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as\nAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for\nthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we\nhave uncovered to date in the Austin market.\nThe project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As\nit is in the "Smart Growth Corridor" area designated by the City of Austin\nfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete\nin less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe\nwater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot\nimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North\nAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street\nwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street\nwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond\nrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.\n The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not\nexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite\nsuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the\nadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.\nAs with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods\nis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may\nonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.

A single buyer entered the \nmarketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices \n($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index.  At the \ntime of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 \ncents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to \nreport into the index calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of \nline with the associated financial swaps for San Juan.\n\n We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from \nSeptember 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from \nEnron Online (EOL), Enron\'s direct phone conversations, and three brokerage \nfirms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a \ntrade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas \ndaily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread \nrelationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:\n\n 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater \nthan the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. \n\n 2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & \nNorthwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and \n       October gas daily.  It doesn\'t make sense to have monthly indeces that \nare dramatically different.\n\n I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the \ntrades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to \ndetermine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70\'s and these trades are \noutliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in \nestablishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron\'s belief that the trades at \n$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the \ncalculation of index.\n\n It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to \nconduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me \nanytime I can assist you towards this goal.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPhillip Allen\nEND CHUNK CONTENT\n\nReturn a strictly valid JSON object with:\n- "label": one of [requirement, decision, stakeholder_feedback, timeline_reference, noise]\n- "confidence": float 0.0 to 1.0 (High confidence means the content explicitly matches the definition)\n- "reasoning": brief explanation of why it fits the label (or why it is noise)\n\nJSON Response:\n'}], 'model': 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.0}}

Crocker" \n<clclegal2@aol.com> \nSubject: Investment Structure\n\nSTRUCTURE:\nTypically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\ngeneral partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\nliability of construction.\n\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor\'s share of profits\nis reduced.\n\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\nnon-recourse.\n\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\n\nEARLY LAND COSTS\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\n\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\nthe "fiscals".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\nimprovements have bee\nEND CHUNK CONTENT\n\nReturn a strictly valid JSON object with:\n- "label": one of [requirement, decision, stakeholder_feedback, timeline_reference, noise]\n- "confidence": float 0.0 to 1.0 (High confidence means the content explicitly matches the definition)\n- "reasoning": brief explanation of why it fits the label (or why it is noise)\n\nJSON Response:\n'}], 'model': 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.0}}

The land is selling for $2.50 per square\nfoot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West\nSan Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.\n\nSeveral new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes\nand for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25\nper square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and\n$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This\nproperty will have the best location for student housing of all new\nprojects, just as the duplexes do now.\n\nIf this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there\nis a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not\nyet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will\nknow more on this question later today.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeorge W.

This would produce an average sq\nfootage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his\nsales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell\nfor $203,108.\nWhat is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the\nrent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own\nevaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the\n3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if we\nwere able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom\nunits along with the 3-bedroom plan.\nPhillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.\nSincerely,\nGeorge W.

A single buyer entered the \nmarketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices \n($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index.  At the \ntime of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 \ncents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to \nreport into the index calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of \nline with the associated financial swaps for San Juan.\n\n We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from \nSeptember 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from \nEnron Online (EOL), Enron\'s direct phone conversations, and three brokerage \nfirms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a \ntrade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas \ndaily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread \nrelationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:\n\n 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater \nthan the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. \n\n 2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & \nNorthwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and \n       October gas daily.  It doesn\'t make sense to have monthly indeces that \nare dramatically different.\n\n I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the \ntrades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to \ndetermine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70\'s and these trades are \noutliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in \nestablishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron\'s belief that the trades at \n$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the \ncalculation of index.\n\n It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to \nconduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me \nanytime I can assist you towards this goal.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPhillip Allen\nEND CHUNK CONTENT\n\nReturn a strictly valid JSON object with:\n- "label": one of [requirement, decision, stakeholder_feedback, timeline_reference, noise]\n- "confidence": float 0.0 to 1.0 (High confidence means the content explicitly matches the definition)\n- "reasoning": brief explanation of why it fits the label (or why it is noise)\n\nJSON Response:\n'}], 'model': 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.0}}

The land is selling for $2.50 per square\nfoot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West\nSan Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.\n\nSeveral new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes\nand for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25\nper square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and\n$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This\nproperty will have the best location for student housing of all new\nprojects, just as the duplexes do now.\n\nIf this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there\nis a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not\nyet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will\nknow more on this question later today.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeorge W.

The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\nliability of construction.\n\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor\'s share of profits\nis reduced.\n\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\nnon-recourse.\n\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\n\nEARLY LAND COSTS\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\n\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\nthe "fiscals".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\nimprovements have bee\nEND CHUNK CONTENT\n\nReturn a strictly valid JSON object with:\n- "label": one of [requirement, decision, stakeholder_feedback, timeline_reference, noise]\n- "confidence": float 0.0 to 1.0 (High confidence means the content explicitly matches the definition)\n- "reasoning": brief explanation of why it fits the label (or why it is noise)\n\nJSON Response:\n'}], 'model': 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.0}}

As you can tell from the proforma this project\nshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.\nThis is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as\nAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for\nthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we\nhave uncovered to date in the Austin market.\nThe project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As\nit is in the "Smart Growth Corridor" area designated by the City of Austin\nfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete\nin less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe\nwater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot\nimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North\nAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street\nwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street\nwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond\nrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.\n The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not\nexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite\nsuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the\nadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.\nAs with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods\nis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may\nonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far\npreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer\npreferences.\nThe seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and\nan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site\nplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into\nan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.\nThis analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the\nprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss\nhaving y\nEND CHUNK CONTENT\n\nReturn a strictly valid JSON object with:\n- "label": one of [requirement, decision, stakeholder_feedback, timeline_reference, noise]\n- "confidence": float 0.0 to 1.0 (High confidence means the content explicitly matches the definition)\n- "reasoning": brief explanation of why it fits the label (or why it is noise)\n\nJSON Response:\n'}], 'model': 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.0}}

This would produce an average sq\nfootage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his\nsales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell\nfor $203,108.\nWhat is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the\nrent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own\nevaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the\n3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if we\nwere able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom\nunits along with the 3-bedroom plan.\nPhillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.\nSincerely,\nGeorge W.

As you can tell from the proforma this project\nshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.\nThis is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as\nAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for\nthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we\nhave uncovered to date in the Austin market.\nThe project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As\nit is in the "Smart Growth Corridor" area designated by the City of Austin\nfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete\nin less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe\nwater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot\nimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North\nAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street\nwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street\nwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond\nrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.\n The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not\nexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite\nsuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the\nadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.\nAs with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods\nis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may\nonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far\npreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer\npreferences.\nThe seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and\nan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site\nplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into\nan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.\nThis analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the\nprofits of the project.

LABEL: noise
CONFIDENCE: 1.0
REASONING: The content appears to be a financial report or analysis, discussing specific transactions and adjustments in various locations (Socal, NWPL, San Juan). It does not contain any statements of need for a new system, product, or process, nor does it include a clear decision about the project direction, design, or scope. There is no stakeholder feedback about the project or product, and no explicit dates or milestones for project delivery or phases. The content is focused on financial data and transactions, making it irrelevant to the project artifacts we are looking to extract.

The land is selling for $2.50 per square\nfoot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West\nSan Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.\n\nSeveral new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes\nand for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25\nper square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and\n$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This\nproperty will have the best location for student housing of all new\nprojects, just as the duplexes do now.\n\nIf this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there\nis a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not\nyet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will\nknow more on this question later today.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeorge W.

This would produce an average sq\nfootage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his\nsales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell\nfor $203,108.\nWhat is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the\nrent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own\nevaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the\n3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if we\nwere able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom\nunits along with the 3-bedroom plan.\nPhillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.\nSincerely,\nGeorge W.

A single buyer entered the \nmarketplace on both September 26 and 27 and paid above market prices \n($4.70-$4.80) for San Juan gas with the intent to distort the index.  At the \ntime of these trades, offers for physical gas at significantly (10 to 15 \ncents) lower prices were bypassed in order to establish higher trades to \nreport into the index calculation.  Additionally, these trades are out of \nline with the associated financial swaps for San Juan.\n\n We have compiled a list of financial and physical trades executed from \nSeptember 25 to September 27.  These are the complete list of trades from \nEnron Online (EOL), Enron\'s direct phone conversations, and three brokerage \nfirms (Amerex, APB, and Prebon).  Please see the attached spreadsheet for a \ntrade by trade list and a summary.  We have also included a summary of gas \ndaily prices to illustrate the value of San Juan based on several spread \nrelationships.  The two key points from this data are as follows:\n\n 1.  The high physical prices on the 26th & 27th (4.75,4,80) are much greater \nthan the high financial trades (4.6375,4.665) on those days. \n\n 2.  The spread relationship between San Juan and other points (Socal & \nNorthwest)  is  consistent between the end of September and \n       October gas daily.  It doesn\'t make sense to have monthly indeces that \nare dramatically different.\n\n I understand you review the trades submitted for outliers.  Hopefully, the \ntrades submitted will reveal counterparty names and you will be able to \ndetermine that there was only one buyer in the 4.70\'s and these trades are \noutliers.  I wanted to give you some additional points of reference to aid in \nestablishing a reasonable index.  It is Enron\'s belief that the trades at \n$4.70 and higher  were above market trades that should be excluded from the \ncalculation of index.\n\n It is our desire to have reliable and accurate indeces against which to \nconduct our physical and financial business.  Please contact me \nanytime I can assist you towards this goal.\n\nSincerely,\n\nPhillip Allen\nEND CHUNK CONTENT\n\nReturn a strictly valid JSON object with:\n- "label": one of [requirement, decision, stakeholder_feedback, timeline_reference, noise]\n- "confidence": float 0.0 to 1.0 (High confidence means the content explicitly matches the definition)\n- "reasoning": brief explanation of why it fits the label (or why it is noise)\n\nJSON Response:\n'}], 'model': 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.0}}

If you do not have the\nability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still\nrequire additional information.\n\nWe need each person\'s email address.

Crocker" \n<clclegal2@aol.com> \nSubject: Investment Structure\n\nSTRUCTURE:\nTypically the structure is a limited partnership with a corporate (or LLC)\ngeneral partner.  The General Partner owns 1% of the project and carries the\nliability of construction.\n\nLAND OWNERSHIP & LOANS\nThe property would be purchased in the name of the limited partnership and\nany land loans, land improvements loans and construction loans would be in\nthe name of the limited partnership.  Each of the individual investors and\nall of the principals in Creekside would also personally guarantee the\nloans.  If the investor(s) do not sign on the loans, this generally means\nthat a larger amount of cash is required and the investor\'s share of profits\nis reduced.\n\nAll loans for residential construction, that are intended for re-sale, are\nfull recourse loans.  If we are pursuing multifamily rental developments,\nthe construction loans are still full recourse but the mortgage can often be\nnon-recourse.\n\nUSE OF INITIAL INVESTMENT\nThe initial investment is used for land deposit, engineering &\narchitectural design, soils tests, surveys, filing fees, legal fees for\norganization and condominium association formation,  and appraisals.  Unlike\nmany real estate investment programs, none of the funds are used for fees to\nCreekside Builders, LLC.  These professional expenses will be incurred over\nthe estimated 6 month design and approval period.\n\nEARLY LAND COSTS\nThe $4,000 per month costs listed in the cash flow as part of land cost\nrepresent the extension fees due to the seller for up to 4 months of\nextensions on closing.  As an alternative, we can close into a land loan at\nprobably 70% of appraised value.  With a land value equal to the purchase\nprice of $680,000 this would mean a land loan of $476,000 with estimated\nmonthly interest payments of $3,966, given a 10% annual interest rate, plus\napproximately 1.25% of the loan amount for closing costs and loan fees.\n\nEQUITY AT IMPROVEMENT LOAN\nOnce the site plan is approved by the City of Austin, the City will require\nthe development entity to post funds for fiscal improvements, referred to as\nthe "fiscals".  This cost represents a bond for the completion of\nimprovements that COA considers vital and these funds are released once the\nimprovements have bee\nEND CHUNK CONTENT\n\nReturn a strictly valid JSON object with:\n- "label": one of [requirement, decision, stakeholder_feedback, timeline_reference, noise]\n- "confidence": float 0.0 to 1.0 (High confidence means the content explicitly matches the definition)\n- "reasoning": brief explanation of why it fits the label (or why it is noise)\n\nJSON Response:\n'}], 'model': 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.0}}

As you can tell from the proforma this project\nshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.\nThis is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as\nAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for\nthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we\nhave uncovered to date in the Austin market.\nThe project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As\nit is in the "Smart Growth Corridor" area designated by the City of Austin\nfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete\nin less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe\nwater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot\nimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North\nAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street\nwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street\nwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond\nrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.\n The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not\nexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite\nsuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the\nadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.\nAs with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods\nis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may\nonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far\npreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer\npreferences.\nThe seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and\nan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site\nplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into\nan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.\nThis analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the\nprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss\nhaving y\nEND CHUNK CONTENT\n\nReturn a strictly valid JSON object with:\n- "label": one of [requirement, decision, stakeholder_feedback, timeline_reference, noise]\n- "confidence": float 0.0 to 1.0 (High confidence means the content explicitly matches the definition)\n- "reasoning": brief explanation of why it fits the label (or why it is noise)\n\nJSON Response:\n'}], 'model': 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.0}}

This would produce an average sq\nfootage of 1233, which would be $73.80 psf at $182,000.  (I thought his\nsales price was $187,000.)  At this price psf our 1,376 sf unit would sell\nfor $203,108.\nWhat is more important, in my view, is a) the rental rate and b) the\nrent-ability.  You have all of our current rental and cost data for your own\nevaluation.  As for rent-ability, I believe that we have shown that the\n3-bedroom, 3.5 bath is strongly preferred in this market.    In fact, if we\nwere able to purchase additional lots from Regan we would build 4 bedroom\nunits along with the 3-bedroom plan.\nPhillip, I will call you today to go over this more thoroughly.\nSincerely,\nGeorge W.

The land is selling for $2.50 per square\nfoot as it is one of only two remaining approved multifamily parcels in West\nSan Marcos, which now has a moratorium on development.\n\nSeveral new studies we have looked at show that the rents for our duplexes\nand for these new units are going to be significantly higher, roughly $1.25\nper square foot if leased for the entire unit on a 12-month lease and\n$1.30-$1.40 psf if leased on a 12-month term, but by individual room.  This\nproperty will have the best location for student housing of all new\nprojects, just as the duplexes do now.\n\nIf this project is of serious interest to you, please let me know as there\nis a very, very short window of opportunity.  The equity requirement is not\nyet known, but it would be likely to be $300,000 to secure the land.  I will\nknow more on this question later today.\n\nSincerely,\n\nGeorge W.

As you can tell from the proforma this project\nshould produce a truly exceptional return of over 40% per year over 3 years.\nThis is especially attractive when the project is in a market as strong as\nAustin and we are introducing new product that in a very low price range for\nthis market.  This is the best project in terms of risk and reward that we\nhave uncovered to date in the Austin market.\nThe project does have approved zoning and will only require a site plan.  As\nit is in the "Smart Growth Corridor" area designated by the City of Austin\nfor preferred development, this will be fast tracked and should be complete\nin less than 6 months.  Additionally, many of the current and more severe\nwater treatment ordinances have been waived.  I have estimated the lot\nimprovement costs based on a 28 lot development we investigated in North\nAustin, which included a detention/retention and filtration pond and street\nwidening.  Even though this property is not likely to require street\nwidening and will have less of a detention/retention and filtration pond\nrequirement, I used this data to be cautious.\n The Lone Star gas line easement in the lower portion of the property is not\nexpected to impact sales significantly.  Other projects have been quite\nsuccessful with identical relationships to this pipeline, such as the\nadjoining single family residential and a project at St. Edwards University.\nAs with most infill projects, the quality of the surrounding neighborhoods\nis uneven.  We have included a fence around the entire property, but may\nonly put it on Westgate and Cameron Loop.  Gated communities are far\npreferred so this is a good idea for both screening and current buyer\npreferences.\nThe seller accepted our offer Thursday evening with a price of $680,000 and\nan extended escrow.  This will enable us to probably obtain an approved site\nplan before closing on the contract, which will mean that we can close into\nan A&D Loan rather than into a land loan and then an improvement loan.\nThis analysis shows your investment at $700,000 for a 50% interest in the\nprofits of the project.  As we discussed in San Marcos, we can also discuss\nhaving y\nEND CHUNK CONTENT\n\nReturn a strictly valid JSON object with:\n- "label": one of [requirement, decision, stakeholder_feedback, timeline_reference, noise]\n- "confidence": float 0.0 to 1.0 (High confidence means the content explicitly matches the definition)\n- "reasoning": brief explanation of why it fits the label (or why it is noise)\n\nJSON Response:\n'}], 'model': 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.0}}

Sitting at the confluence of several \nfiber optic backbones, the\n                  Exodus plant will consume enough power for a small town and \neventually\n                  house Internet servers for firms such as Avenue A, \nMicrosoft and Onvia.com. \n\n                       Exodus is not the only company building massive data \ncenters near Seattle.\n                  More than a dozen companies -- with names like AboveNet, \nGlobix and\n                  HostPro -- are looking for facilities here that will house \nthe networking\n                  equipment of the Internet economy. \n\n                       It is a big business that could have an effect on \neverything from your\n                  monthly electric bill to the ease with which you access \nyour favorite Web sites.\n\n                       Data centers, also known as co-location facilities and \nserver farms, are\n                  sprouting at such a furious pace in Tukwila and the Kent \nValley that some\n                  have expressed concern over whether Seattle City Light and \nPuget Sound\n                  Energy can handle the power necessary to run these 24-hour, \nhigh-security\n                  facilities. \n\n                       "We are talking to about half a dozen customers that \nare requesting 445\n                  megawatts of power in a little area near Southcenter Mall," \nsaid Karl\n                  Karzmar, manager of revenue requirements for Puget Sound \nEnergy. "That is\n                  the equivalent of six oil refineries." \n\n                       A relatively new phenomenon in the utility business, \nthe rise of the Internet\n                  data cen\nEND CHUNK CONTENT\n\nReturn a strictly valid JSON object with:\n- "label": one of [requirement, decision, stakeholder_feedback, timeline_reference, noise]\n- "confidence": float 0.0 to 1.0 (High confidence means the content explicitly matches the definition)\n- "reasoning": brief explanation of why it fits the label (or why it is noise)\n\nJSON Response:\n'}], 'model': 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.0}}

We appreciate your prompt attention and completing the Team\nSelection information.\n\nIdeally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the Team Selection form\nwe sent you.  The information needed is then easily transferred into the\ndatabase directly from that Excel spreadsheet.  If you do not have the\nability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still\nrequire additional information.\n\nWe need each person\'s email address.  Without the email address, we cannot\nemail them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can\nwe send them an automatic reminder via email.  It would also be good to have\neach person\'s phone number, in the event we need to reach them.\n\nSo, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need\nto instead, provide the needed information via email.\n\nThank you for your assistance Phillip.\n\nChristi L.

The information needed is then easily transferred into the\ndatabase directly from that Excel spreadsheet.  If you do not have the\nability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still\nrequire additional information.\n\nWe need each person\'s email address.  Without the email address, we cannot\nemail them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can\nwe send them an automatic reminder via email.  It would also be good to have\neach person\'s phone number, in the event we need to reach them.\n\nSo, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need\nto instead, provide the needed information via email.\n\nThank you for your assistance Phillip.\n\nChristi L.

We appreciate your prompt attention and completing the Team\nSelection information.\n\nIdeally, we needed to receive your team of raters on the Team Selection form\nwe sent you.  The information needed is then easily transferred into the\ndatabase directly from that Excel spreadsheet.  If you do not have the\nability to complete that form, inserting what you listed below, we still\nrequire additional information.\n\nWe need each person\'s email address.  Without the email address, we cannot\nemail them their internet link and ID to provide feedback for you, nor can\nwe send them an automatic reminder via email.  It would also be good to have\neach person\'s phone number, in the event we need to reach them.\n\nSo, we do need to receive that complete TS Excel spreadsheet, or if you need\nto instead, provide the needed information via email.\n\nThank you for your assistance Phillip.\n\nChristi L.

Now that we have had several traders \nmanaging transportation positions for several months, I would like to discuss \nany issues you have with the way the model works.   I have asked Zimin Lu \n(Research), Mark Breese and John Griffith (Structuring) to attend so they \nwill be available to answer any technical questions.   The point of this \nmeeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is \ncomfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those \nwho are managing the books believe in the model\'s results.   Since I have \nheard a few concerns, I hope you will take advantage of this opportunity to \ndiscuss them.\n\nPlease let me know if you are unable to attend.\nEND CHUNK CONTENT\n\nReturn a strictly valid JSON object with:\n- "label": one of [requirement, decision, stakeholder_feedback, timeline_reference, noise]\n- "confidence": float 0.0 to 1.0 (High confidence means the content explicitly matches the definition)\n- "reasoning": brief explanation of why it fits the label (or why it is noise)\n\nJSON Response:\n'}], 'model': 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.0}}

Here are my observations:\n\n  Gas Sales 916,000/day x 365 days = 334,340,000/year\n  \n  Estimated Gas Prices $985,721,000/334,340,000= $2.95/mcf\n\n  Actual gas prices are around $1.00/mcf higher and rising. \n\n   Recalc of EPS with more accurate gas prices:\n  (334,340,000 mct X $1/mcf)/116,897,000 shares outst = $2.86 additional EPS \nX 12 P/E multiple = $34 a share\n\n That is just a back of the envelope valuation based on gas prices.  I think \ncrude price are undervalued by the tune of $10/share.\n\n Current price 37\n Nat. Gas 34\n Crude  10\n\n Total  81\n\n \n Can you take a look at these numbers and play devil\'s advocate?  To me this \nlooks like the best stock to own Also can you send me a report on Calpine, \nTosco, and SLB?\n\nThank you,\n\n Phillip\nEND CHUNK CONTENT\n\nReturn a strictly valid JSON object with:\n- "label": one of [requirement, decision, stakeholder_feedback, timeline_reference, noise]\n- "confidence": float 0.0 to 1.0 (High confidence means the content explicitly matches the definition)\n- "reasoning": brief explanation of why it fits the label (or why it is noise)\n\nJSON Response:\n'}], 'model': 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.0}}

The point of this \nmeeting is to get all issues out in the open and make sure everyone is \ncomfortable with using the model and position manager, and to make sure those \nwho are managing the books believe in the model\'s results.

Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month \nindex may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That \nrisk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of \ntheir PGA\'s and see if there is an opportunity.\n\nAs to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?

In preparation for that meeting we would like to \ngain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.  \nCould you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are \ntypical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?  \nHow much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main \ncontacts at SW Gas?\n\nWe will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our \ncontrol of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably \nhave to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the \ncommissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their \ncommissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) \nshould look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month \nindex may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That \nrisk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of \ntheir PGA\'s and see if there is an opportunity.\n\nAs to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are \nthere elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly \nappreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\nLaird\nEND CHUNK CONTENT\n\nReturn a strictly valid JSON object with:\n- "label": one of [requirement, decision, stakeholder_feedback, timeline_reference, noise]\n- "confidence": float 0.0 to 1.0 (High confidence means the content explicitly matches the definition)\n- "reasoning": brief explanation of why it fits the label (or why it is noise)\n\nJSON Response:\n'}], 'model': 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.0}}

In preparation for that meeting we would like to \ngain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.  \nCould you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are \ntypical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?  \nHow much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main \ncontacts at SW Gas?\n\nWe will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our \ncontrol of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably \nhave to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the \ncommissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their \ncommissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) \nshould look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month \nindex may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That \nrisk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of \ntheir PGA\'s and see if there is an opportunity.\n\nAs to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are \nthere elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly \nappreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\nLaird\nEND CHUNK CONTENT\n\nReturn a strictly valid JSON object with:\n- "label": one of [requirement, decision, stakeholder_feedback, timeline_reference, noise]\n- "confidence": float 0.0 to 1.0 (High confidence means the content explicitly matches the definition)\n- "reasoning": brief explanation of why it fits the label (or why it is noise)\n\nJSON Response:\n'}], 'model': 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.0}}

In preparation for that meeting we would like to \ngain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.  \nCould you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are \ntypical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?  \nHow much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main \ncontacts at SW Gas?\n\nWe will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our \ncontrol of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably \nhave to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the \ncommissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their \ncommissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) \nshould look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month \nindex may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That \nrisk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of \ntheir PGA\'s and see if there is an opportunity.\n\nAs to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are \nthere elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly \nappreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\nLaird\nEND CHUNK CONTENT\n\nReturn a strictly valid JSON object with:\n- "label": one of [requirement, decision, stakeholder_feedback, timeline_reference, noise]\n- "confidence": float 0.0 to 1.0 (High confidence means the content explicitly matches the definition)\n- "reasoning": brief explanation of why it fits the label (or why it is noise)\n\nJSON Response:\n'}], 'model': 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.0}}

In preparation for that meeting we would like to \ngain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.  \nCould you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are \ntypical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?  \nHow much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main \ncontacts at SW Gas?\n\nWe will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our \ncontrol of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably \nhave to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the \ncommissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their \ncommissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) \nshould look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month \nindex may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That \nrisk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of \ntheir PGA\'s and see if there is an opportunity.\n\nAs to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are \nthere elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly \nappreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\nLaird\nEND CHUNK CONTENT\n\nReturn a strictly valid JSON object with:\n- "label": one of [requirement, decision, stakeholder_feedback, timeline_reference, noise]\n- "confidence": float 0.0 to 1.0 (High confidence means the content explicitly matches the definition)\n- "reasoning": brief explanation of why it fits the label (or why it is noise)\n\nJSON Response:\n'}], 'model': 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.0}}

In preparation for that meeting we would like to \ngain an understanding of the nature of our business relationship with SW.  \nCould you, in general terms, describe our sales activities with SW.  What are \ntypical quantities and term on sales?  Are there any services we provide?  \nHow much pipeline capacity do we buy or sell to them?  Who are your main \ncontacts at SW Gas?\n\nWe will propose to provide a full requirements supply to SW involving our \ncontrol of their assets.  For this to be attractive to SW, we will probably \nhave to take on their regulatory risk on gas purchase disallowance with the \ncommissions.  This will be difficult as there is no clear mandate from their \ncommissions as to what an acceptable portfolio (fixed, indexed, collars....) \nshould look like.  Offering them a guaranteed discount to the 1st of month \nindex may not be attractive unless we accept their regulatory risk.  That \nrisk may not be acceptable to the desk.  I will do some investigation of \ntheir PGA\'s and see if there is an opportunity.\n\nAs to the asset management:  do you have any preference on structure?  Are \nthere elements that you would like to see?  Any ideas at all would be greatly \nappreciated.\n\nThanks,\n\nLaird\nEND CHUNK CONTENT\n\nReturn a strictly valid JSON object with:\n- "label": one of [requirement, decision, stakeholder_feedback, timeline_reference, noise]\n- "confidence": float 0.0 to 1.0 (High confidence means the content explicitly matches the definition)\n- "reasoning": brief explanation of why it fits the label (or why it is noise)\n\nJSON Response:\n'}], 'model': 'meta-llama/llama-4-maverick-17b-128e-instruct', 'response_format': {'type': 'json_object'}, 'temperature': 0.0}}
